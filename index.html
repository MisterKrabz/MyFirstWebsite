    These are the top 10 modern cars. Many people love to drive around in old facebook marketplace cars, but if you ask me, 
    Id rather fork over a little more money to get something a little more modern than go on craiglist to get a shitbox that 
    might blow up any day. A new sports car can be a daily driver and a track monster at the same time and will last longer 
    allowing you to make more memories with your car. This is why I compiled this list for all of you. Now I must admit, as an Asian 
    dude, I may be biased towards JDM and it may show in the rankings (significantly), but here is my top 10 cars wishlist, their 
    specs, and their ranks on the Patrick Scale. <br></br> <b>Feel free to buy me any of these pls.</b>

    The <b>Volkswagen Golf R</b> is a nice little sporty hot hatch. But it stops at just about there. I cant get myself behind
    the appearance of the Golf R, because it blends in with normal traffic too well and doesnt feel very special. Specs wise, 
    this is a solid choice but this little guy just isnt exactly handsome.

    The <b>Hyundai Elantra</b> is pretty OP for its price ngl. I think hyundai is only making this car
    so cheap so they can dip their toes in the competative sports car market while competing against 
    other brands that have legacy. So why isnt it higher up on the list? Its because Legacy. Hyundai lacks 
    history as it is a relativelt new brand, but if you are just in it for the specs, then this car will 
    give you the best bang for your buck out of all of the cars here.

    The <b>Subaru WRX STI</b> is a rally legend built for the road. My parents own a forester, but its not exactly as fun as this WRX. 
    This guy's got performance and plenty of leg room, and its built to handle both the track and the off road. twisty backroads to 
    city streets. Its extremely versitile and fun to drive, but it also falls into the trap of blending into regular traffic. This was 
    the last WRX STI Subaru is making, which is pretty sad and shows how they are transitioning as a company from focusing on fun cars 
    to family cars, which means its hard to be rizzy when pulling up in one of these newer Subarus.

    The <b>Honda Civic</b> is a darty kind of car. I drove a civic during high school, and I have to say, for a cheap economy
    car like that, it sure is zippy through the streets. Sometimes, I feel like I am driving a go cart when I am in that thing. So 
    why isnt it higher up on the list? Its got legacy. Its got power. But what its missing is once again, uniqueness. It just blends 
    in with common traffic too well. We know the type R is capable, but Honda doesnt do a lot to distinguish the type R from the 
    civics you see sitting in traffic, which basically makes it harder to rizz with. Furthermore, the front wheel drive system makes 
    this car basically impossible to drift unless its snowing, which is why even though it feels like a go cart, this car doesnt rank 
    very well for fun to drive category.

    The <b>Dodge Challenger</b>  is an American muscle car with serious attitude. Its got some serious retro-inspired looks with 
    combined with modern power. If you just love that classic American coupe vibe, the Challenger delivers. But this just makes
    the discontinuation of the gas challenger even sadder, as it signals the end of the American muscle car era. Overall though, the 
    challenger doesnt exactly look that cool or unique in my eyes, as it somehow also blends in with regular traffic despite its retro 
    modern design. I cant pinpoint exactly where the design is lacking, but older challengers are definately better that the new one. 
    Furthermore, this car is too heavy and heavy cars dont seem very fun to drive, so its definately being held back a couple of points.

    The <b>Mazda MX-5 Miata</b> is getting into fun and zippy territory now. For the price, you dont get a lot of car so it looses out 
    especially for GYATT, but I think Mazda's priority with the MX-5 was quality over quantity because it seems like a blast on the weekends. 
    Its a cute car, so its got tons of rizz, and its built to be so tiny that it stands out amongst traffic. The main issues with the miata is 
    that it doesnt have rear seats so you cant fit all the bois in one car, and the shorter wheelbase probably makes it harder to actually 
    drift with.

    The <b>BMW M2</b> is a compact powerhouse that packs big performance into a hard to miss package. With its gnarly sounding
    turbocharged engine, this car is hard to beat on the rizz meter. This one is definately on the pricy side for what its worth

    The <b>Ford Mustang</b> is an American icon. With its powerful engine, 
    retro design, and thrilling performance, this pony car is built to do doughnuts in high school parking lots. 
    Its got an AMAZING GYATT due to its well implemented retro inspired rear end and it probably drives similarly to older models 
    giving it amazing legacy. But its front end is missing style due to the minimalist design, making it less attention grabbing 
    than I would like for a car of this caliber.

    The <b>Toyota Supra</b> is a masterpiece of performance and design. Unfortunately, Toyota dropped the 2JZ opting for a BMW engine instead 
    which is a real bummer to the legacy of this car as one of the most tuneable street racers in the past. Otherwise, there isnt much to 
    complain about as it is still one of the most handsome cars out there. Everything from the slope of the front end to the proportions of 
    the hood to cab ratio is amazing eye candy and this handsome car will for sure catch anyone's attention in the parking lot.

    #1 - Nissan 400z Nismo 2024
    </a></h2>
    <h3>Stats: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>MSRP: $65,750</li>
        <li>engine: 3.0L twin turbo V6</li>
        <li>0-60: 5.3 seconds</li>
        <li>horsepower: 420 at 6,400 rpm</li>
        <li>torque: 384 lb-ft at 2,000 rpm</li>
        <li>transmission: 9 speed automatic</li>
    </ul>
    The <b>Nissan 400Z</b> has one of the most beutiful GYATs I have ever seen on a car. The black accent on the back is a real nice touch by
    nissan and definately took a lot of work designing. Alongside its versitile engine and moderately strong legacy, it’s a sleek and (somewhat!) 
    affordable car that is the most handsome of them all. I know I dogged on the mx-5 for not having rear seats, but I dont even care about that 
    anymore when it comes to the Z, as owning a Z has been one of my dreams since childhood. I am glad Nissan continues to come out with new 
    Z cars while also being a manufacturer of common traffic so as older Z models age, prospective buyers have more reliable options to choose from.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    so there you have it! the list of the top 10 most stylish, capable, and affordable modern sports cars. You may have seen that I am 
    partially biased towards JDM cars, and that may be true. But hey, its objectively true that Nissan and Toyota know how to make a good 
    car as they are some of the most popular automotive manufacturers in the USA. Also, the Mustang and Challenger would have ranked higher 
    if Ford and Dodge had spent more time designing a handsome car. In the end, now you all know some of my favorite cars so when the times 
    are going well, feel free to get me either of these as a gift!
